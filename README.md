# Sales Prediction using Simple Linear Regression for Rossmann Stores

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a sales prediction project focused on forecasting daily sales for Rossmann stores across 7 European countries. The goal is to develop a predictive model using simple linear regression, leveraging historical sales data from 1,115 Rossmann stores.

## Research Goal
The primary objective is to create an accurate predictive model that anticipates the "Sales" column in the test set. The model is designed to consider the dynamic and diverse conditions influencing store performance, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality. Notably, the dataset includes instances where certain stores were temporarily closed for refurbishment, introducing complexity to the sales prediction task.

## Methodology
The project exclusively employs simple linear regression to model the relationship between relevant features and the target variable, "Sales." Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be conducted to gain insights into the dataset, and feature engineering will be limited to simple transformations. The model will be trained and validated using historical data, and its performance will be evaluated on the test set.

## Key Challenges
The dataset's unique challenge involves handling temporary store closures for refurbishment. The simplicity of the linear regression model may require additional consideration and refinement to address such complexities effectively.

## Data
The dataset encompasses comprehensive information on Rossmann store operations, including store attributes, product details, promotions, and historical sales data. The aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of a straightforward linear regression approach in predicting sales.

## Dependencies
The project relies on common data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. The code is written in Python, and Jupyter Notebooks are used for interactive development and analysis.

## Contributions
Contributions and feedback from the open-source community are welcome. Whether you're interested in refining the linear regression model, addressing specific challenges, or improving documentation, your contributions will enhance the project's value.

Let's collaborate to create a straightforward yet effective sales prediction model for Rossmann stores using simple linear regression!
